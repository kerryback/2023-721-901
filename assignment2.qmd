### Module 2 Assignments<br>BUSI 721<br>Data Driven Finance I<br><br>![](RiceBusiness-transparent-logo-sm.png){height="50"}<br>

The assignments for Module 2 (other than Discussion Board assignments) are presented below.  For each  assignment, submit a Jupyter notebook on Canvas.  If there are multiple questions in an assignment, copy each question into a Markdown cell and provide your answer in the cell or cells below it.

#### 2.2. Stock Returns 

Download adjusted closing prices for CVX and SPY from Yahoo Finance and compute annual returns.  Get the prices with only one call to the pandas datareader by inputting the list ["CVX", "SPY"] as the first argument.  Use "1970-01-01" as the start date and "2021-12-31" as the end date.  Use the code from class to compute the annual returns.  

Some things worth pointing out:

(a) The CVX returns will start in 1971 because when you down-sample to the last date of the year, the first date will be the end of 1970 and then when you compute percent changes the first non-missing value will be for 1971.  
(b) SPY did not exist before 1993, so you will get NaNs as adjusted closing prices for SPY prior to 1993.  
(c) You cannot use an earlier start date than "1970-01-01" because Yahoo does not provide data prior to 1970.
(d) The name of Chevron Corp. and its ticker symbol changed several times over the years as it changed from being part of Standard Oil and then acquired Texaco.  But all of the data is available from Yahoo under the ticker symbol CVX.  

#### 2.4 Daily Returns 

Download adjusted closing prices for AAPL and compute daily, monthly, and annual returns for the five-year period 2017-2021.  Construct three box plots - one for each set of returns.  Use "2016-12-30" as the start date.  What can we tell about outliers from the box plots?

#### 2.5 Geometric Average Returns 

Using Yahoo's adjusted closing prices, compute annual returns for AAPL for the period 2000 through 2021.  Calculate the arithmetic average annual return and the geometric average annual return.

#### 2.6 Long Run Risk 

Draw 1,000 sets of 30 normally distributed random variables with a mean of 6% and a standard deviation of 10%. Viewing the variables as annual returns, compound them year by year over each 30-year period to obtain 1,000 time series of accumulations . 

(1) Calculate and plot the standard deviation of the accumulations through each year (the x-axis should be 1, 2, ..., 30 and the y-axis should be the std dev of the accumulation through year 1, year 2, ..., year 30).  

(2) If the accumulation is less than 1, then an investment has lost money. 
 Calculate and plot the fraction of the 1,000 returns for which the accumulation is less than 1 year-by-year (the plot should be the same as in (1) but the y-axis should have the fraction of losses through year 1, year 2, ..., year 30).
