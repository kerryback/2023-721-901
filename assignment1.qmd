The six assignments for Module 1 are provided below.  For each assignment, submit a Jupyter notebook on Canvas.  If there are multiple questions in an assignment, copy each question into a Markdown cell and provide your answer in the cell or cells below it.

#### 1.1  Present and Future Values

Answer each of the following.

(1) I have $50,000 now and I plan to invest $20,000 in one year and another $20,000 at the end of the following four years (five investments of $20,000 in five years in total). If I earn 6% per year on my investments, what will I have at the end of the five years, including the final investment?

(2) I have $50,000 now and plan to invest money at the end of this year and also for the following four years (five investments in five years in total). I expect to earn 6% per year. I hope to have $200,000 at the end of the five years, including the last investment. How much do I need to invest each year? 

#### 1.2 Monthly Rates, etc.

An investment earned 10%, 15%, -8%, -3%, and 20% over a five-year span.  Answer each of the following.

(1) What were the corresponding continuously compounded returns?

(2) What was the sum of the continuously compounded returns?

(3) If you started with $1 and earned these returns, what did you have at the end of the five years?

(4) How does the natural exponential of the sum of the continuously compounded returns compare to the answer to (3)?

#### 1.3 Mortgage Payments, etc.

Answer each of the following.

(1) What would the monthly payments be on a 5-year loan for $40,000 at 6%?

(2) How much can I borrow on a 5-year loan at 6% if I can afford to pay $500 per month?

(3) If I want to borrow $40,000 on a 5-year loan and can afford to pay $500 per month, what monthly interest rate do I need to get?  If a bank quotes an annual rate, what annual rate would I need?

#### 1.4 Inflation and Real Returns

Answer each of the following.

(1) An investment earned 10%, 15%, -8%, -3%, and 20% over a five-year span. Inflation over the five years was 3%, 5%, 7%, 4%, and 2%.

(2) How much did $1 at the beginning of the five years grow to in nominal terms?
In real terms?

#### 1.5 Retirement Planning

You plan to make monthly deposits to an account for the next 30 years and then make monthly withdrawals for 30 years with the same timing as in the lecture.  There is $100,000 in the account now.  Your first deposit will be $1,000 and the deposits will grow at 0.2% per month.  Your withdrawals will be constant.  Answer each of the following.

(1) How much can you withdraw each month if you make (a) 0.3% per month, (b) 0.5% per month, (c) 0.8% per month?

(2) Plot the account balance over time for part (b) of question 1.

#### 1.6 Time-Varying Returns

You plan to make monthly deposits to an account for the next 30 years and then make monthly withdrawals for 30 years with the same timing as in the lecture.  There is $100,000 in the account now.  Your first deposit will be $1,000 and the deposits will grow at 0.2% per month.  From the previous set of practice questions, we know that you can withdraw $11,486.69 per month in retirement if you earn 0.5% per month on your investments.  Suppose your actual returns are normally distributed with a mean of 0.5% per month and a standard deviation of 4% per month.  Simulate returns and calculate the ending balance if you withdraw $11,486.69 per month and all of the other parameters are as specified.  Repeat this 1,000 times and plot a histogram of the 1,000 ending balances from the 1,000 simulations.
